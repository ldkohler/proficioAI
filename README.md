## Unimplemented Features

Due to the time constraints, there were many features designed and constructed, but to allow for a clean final product, these features had to have been dropped. We still want to showcase these features, as a possible future implementation:

### Code Interview

Along with training with verbal responses, there was also a feature for the user to practice coding common interview questions based on the job posting. The user would get a detailed report on how they did, where they could do better, and common practices


### Enhanced Response

A premium feature we were considering were Enhanced Response, where the user could spend more credits to get an even more indepth response.
